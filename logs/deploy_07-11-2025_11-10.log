CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS charity_website

ERROR 1044 (42000) at line 2: Access denied for user 'theomkiq_charity'@'localhost' to database 'charity_website'
❌ SQL schema import failed. Check database credentials.
⚠️  You may need to import manually via phpMyAdmin

=====================================================
📋 DEPLOYMENT SUMMARY
=====================================================
✅ Frontend: Deployed to ~/public_html
⚠️  Backend: Uploaded to ~/nodejs
⚠️  Database: Schema deployment attempted

🔧 NEXT STEPS:
1. ⚠️  IMPORTANT: Update database credentials in script:
   - REMOTE_DB_USER (usually: cpanel_username_dbuser)
   - REMOTE_DB_PASS (your cPanel database password)
   - REMOTE_DB_NAME (usually: cpanel_username_dbname)

2. If SQL import failed, import manually:
   - Login to cPanel → phpMyAdmin
   - Select database: theomkiq_charity
   - Click 'Import' → Upload database/schema.sql

3. Check if your cPanel supports Node.js applications
4. If yes, configure Node.js app in cPanel to run server.js
5. If no, deploy backend to:
   - VPS (DigitalOcean, AWS EC2, etc.)
   - Heroku
   - Railway
   - Render
   - Or any Node.js hosting service

6. Update frontend API URL to point to your backend server
7. Configure database connection in backend .env file
